Password Generator

Overview
This project involves creating a password generator application that runs in the browser. The application allows users to generate random passwords based on selected criteria such as length and character types. The interface is built with HTML and CSS, while the password generation logic is implemented in JavaScript. The goal is to provide a secure and easy-to-use tool for generating strong passwords.

Objectives
Develop a dynamic web application using JavaScript.
Implement a password generator that meets user-defined criteria.
Enhance understanding of DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.
Create a responsive and polished user interface.
Instructions
Setup: Clone the starter code repository and open the project in your code editor.

User Interaction:

When the "Generate Password" button is clicked, a series of prompts will ask the user for their password criteria.
Prompts include:
Desired password length (must be between 8 and 128 characters).
Inclusion of uppercase letters.
Inclusion of lowercase letters.
Inclusion of numeric characters.
Inclusion of special characters.

Validation:
Ensure at least one character type is selected.
Validate that the password length is within the specified range.
If any criteria are not met, prompt the user again until valid input is received.
Password Generation:

Once criteria are collected and validated, generate a random password that matches the selected options.
Display the generated password either in an alert box or write it to the page.
Testing:

Test the application to ensure it functions correctly across different browsers and screen sizes.
Verify that all prompts work as expected and that the generated password meets the selected criteria.
